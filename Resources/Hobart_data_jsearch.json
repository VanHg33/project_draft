We obsessively seek out elegant, robust ways to enable our customers to find, acknowledge, and remediate cyber risks. With UpGuard, organisations leverage our security expertise and software to automate what were once laborious, spreadsheet-driven processes\u2013monitoring the attack surface of hundreds of vendors or assessing the security of their own infrastructure. UpGuard is used by some of the world\u2019s largest, fastest growing and most innovative companies.\n\nWhy are we hiring for this role?\nAs UpGuard continues to scale at an increasing rate, each of our teams, from Product to Sales, is becoming more data and insight hungry. As a result, our central Analytics and BI function is bandwidth constrained and needs to scale with our business growth.\n\nAs a Senior Business Analyst, you will be responsible for ensuring that all teams not only have access to the data they need but also provide powerful insights that can help UpGuard scale and make important decisions. You will be able to use your understanding of business structure and processes to understand stakeholder needs and provide them with the correct information and insights in the most useful and concise format.\n\nWe are looking for someone with 4+ years of experience working in both Analytics and Business Operations roles. Candidates should have a Bachelor's Degree in a Mathematical, IT, Science or Engineering field. As our team is currently small, we're looking for someone who is self-sufficient.\nWhat you will accomplish\n\u2022 Understand the business data needs of various teams within the organisation, from stakeholders that do and do not have a technical background. A successful candidate will not only be able to digest requirements but also converse with stakeholders in a constructive and comfortable manner, as you are providing \u201ccustomer support\u201d to other teams.\n\u2022 Be able to transform raw data into useful insights through the use of our Business Intelligence platform and present information in a way that conveys powerful and pertinent insights for stakeholders. Our BI platform is Looker, so we are looking for candidates who are familiar with both the Explore/Look/Dashboard side of Looker as well as have experience with the Developer side of Looker.\n\u2022 Be able to learn and understand our business processes, from our sales pipeline structure to our product usage metrics.\n\u2022 Be able to undertake projects around trend analysis, seasonality and other more complex mathematical analyses on behalf of stakeholders.\n\u2022 Be able to not only suggest areas of improvement for our processes, teams and infrastructure but also be able to plan, implement and test the proposed solution.\nWhat would give you an edge? We have a Google Platform-based BI-stack.

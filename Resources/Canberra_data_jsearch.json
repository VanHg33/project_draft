The ATSB is governed by a Commission and is entirely separate from transport regulators, policy makers and service providers.\n\nThe ATSB's purpose is to improve safety of, and public confidence in, aviation, marine and rail transport through:\n\u2022 independent investigation of transport accidents and other safety occurrences\n\u2022 safety data recording, analysis and research\n\u2022 fostering safety awareness, knowledge and action.\nThe ATSB is established by the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 (TSI Act) and conducts its investigations in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Under the TSI Act, it is not a function of the ATSB to apportion blame or provide a means for determining liability. The ATSB does not investigate for the purpose of taking administrative, regulatory or criminal action.\n\nThe Bureau's Commission is constituted by a full-time Commissioner/CEO and three part-time Commissioners. The ATSB's staff (approximately 100) includes about 60 aviation, marine and rail safety investigators. While the majority of staff are based in Canberra, we also have regional offices located in Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth.\n\nThe key duties of the position include\nAbout the role\n\nThe Data Recovery Analyst is a member of a small team of transport safety professionals who apply engineering science to the investigation and analysis of transport safety occurrences.\n\nThe Data Recovery Analyst provides technical support to the operations teams, in aviation, marine and rail transport modes, by assisting in the recovery, analysis and presentation of data from transport vehicles and supporting infrastructure. Traditionally, this data has been provided by dedicated recording devices (such as cockpit voice recorders, flight data recorders, voyage data recorders), however the increasing implementation and use of technologies such as quick-access recorders, digital engine control systems, embedded GPS devices, alongside personal electronic devices and video and audio recordings has provided a growing range of data sources from which evidence may be obtained. Where devices are damaged, this can include recovering binary data at the chip level, and associated interpretation and validation of binary data to engineering units.\n\nIn this role you will be responsible for:\n\u2022 Downloading data from a broad range of electronic devices. Devices may include all types of phones, various GPS devices, iPads/tablets, flight recorders (FDR, CVR), on-train data recorder and/or event recorder, and marine voyage data recorders. If the device has been damaged in the accident it will require dedication to extract the data ready for analysis.\n\u2022 Undertaking detailed analysis of the data recovered, in-line with ATSB processes, a prepare briefs or reports or presentations for the purpose of improving safety within various transport industries.\n\u2022 Working along-side or being mentored by senior ATSB investigators on an accident site or in the ATSB's technical facilities, using own subject matter expertise to contribute to complex safety investigation activities.\n\u2022 Ensuring data recovery and lab equipment (hardware and software) is procured and maintained to a high standard, and procedures are in place for the safe operation of all equipment, and the efficient and accurate recovery of data.\n\u2022 Undertaking project work to advance unique data initiatives for the ATSB, includes working collaboratively with external stakeholders and/or other government agencies.\n\u2022 Actively contributing to, and promoting the ATSB and APS values and culture, and the ATSB's promotion of transport safety awareness.",
